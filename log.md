Turns out the IR LEDs that I wanted to use are not bright enough to shine across my room (10 ft) to the IR sensor on the ceiling. To solve this, I'm going to put an old Arduino board on my desk underneath the IR sensor mounted on the ceiling. I'll connect a 433mhz transmitter/receiver and IR LED to it. I will have the Pi communicate via 433mhz radio to the Arduino, which will send an IR signal up to the sensor as well as a confirmation signal so the Pi knows the signal was delivered.
